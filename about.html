            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'langar';">
                "I'm Anas Khyzar, a BSCS student with a passion for photography.
                <br>I have been immersed in the world of photography
                since 2018, honing my skills and exploring various genres.
                <br>
                While I enjoy capturing all kinds of
                subjects, my favorites are nature and automobile photography.
                <br>
                For me, photography is more than just a hobby;
                <br>
                it is a form of self-expression and a way to find solace.
                As I embrace
                the quote,
                <br>
                'Art comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable,' I strive to convey this philosophy
                through my art.
                <br>
                I believe that art has the power to evoke emotions, challenge perspectives, and provide comfort.
                <br>
                Whenever I feel low, sad, or lonely, I turn to my camera. It becomes my sanctuary, allowing me to lose
                myself in the
                creative process and find solace in capturing moments.
                <br>
                My approach to photography often leans towards a
                cinematic
                aesthetic, adding a touch of drama and storytelling to my images.
                <br>
                While I haven't worked with notable clients or projects yet, I am dedicated to continuously improving my
                craft and
                exploring new opportunities. If you resonate with my style and would like to collaborate or discuss
                photography, feel
                free to reach out to me."
                <br>
                Remember!
                <br>
                "Art Comforts the Disturbed and Disturbs the Comfortable".
